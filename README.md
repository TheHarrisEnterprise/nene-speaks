struggles in her life like drugs, gangs, and struggles with suicidal thoughts. When GOD set her free from these things,
she gained the desire to see others free. And now by the grace of god  she is preaching a powerful word of deliverance
with hopes that many would be drawn to the Lord. She aims to Minister and encourage broken hearted people and lost souls
hoping they would experience freedom and new life through Jesus Christ just as she has. Denisha feels it is her duty to 
be an instrument for Christ after all he is done in her life. she has preached at churches like Second Calvacade Baptist Church,
Jericho City Church if God, and new Mt.Olive Baptist Church just to name a few. Her number one goal is just to inspire the
world and to be an example of many.
